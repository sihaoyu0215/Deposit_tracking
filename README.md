# Att-YOLO
This project is for efficient and accurate deposit detection and tracking within pipelines, based on the combination of YOLOX (for detection) and BYTE (for tracking).

The framework is developed based on the open-source tool MMTracking. The model configuration file used in this paper is located at "./configs/mot/myconfigs/deposit_tracking_bytetrack.py".

The video data annotation process is conducted with the aid of Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT).
