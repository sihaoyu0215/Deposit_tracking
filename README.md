# Deposit_tracking
This project aims to enable efficient and accurate deposit detection and tracking within pipelines, leveraging a multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithm that combines YOLOX (for detection) and BYTE (for tracking).

The framework is developed based on the open-source tool MMTracking. The model configuration file used in this paper is located at "./configs/mot/myconfigs/deposit_tracking_bytetrack.py".

Video data annotation is performed with the assistance of the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT).
